# PROBLEM

What happens if a node comes back up as a secondary after a period of being offline and the oplog has looped on the primary?

Choose the best answer:

- [ ] The entire dataset will be copied from the primary
- [ ] A rollback will occur
- [ ] The new node stays offline (does not re-join the replica set)
- [ ] The new node begins to calculate Pi to a large number of decimal places
